Automatic classifyer of Sleep stages using deep learning

<b>This is a work in progress. The goal is to train an ANN to detect sleep stages in human EEG using Python and Tensorflow</b>

</br>Accuracy so far lies at ~60% for 6 stages (wake, REM, NREM1:4) with minor preprocessing. Not good, I know, but its a start!
